# Naive-bayes-Algorithm
Implemented Naive base algorithm from scratch 

Here are the steps to run the program from the console:

1.	Open the console (terminal or command prompt) on your computer.
2.	Navigate to the directory where the main.py file is located using the 'cd' command. For example, if the file is located on your desktop, type 'cd Desktop' and press Enter.
3.	List the contents of the directory using the 'ls' command to make sure you can see the file.
4.	Navigate to the folder where the program files are located using the 'cd' command. For example, if the folder is named 'Yashwanth' and is located on your desktop, type 'cd Yashwanth' and press Enter.
5.	List the contents of the folder using the 'ls' command to make sure you can see the program files.
6.	Type 'python main.py' and press Enter to run the program.
7.	The program will display a menu with four options. Enter the number corresponding to the option you want to select, and press Enter. For example, if you want to build the model, type '1' and press Enter.
8.	Depending on the option you selected, the program may prompt you to enter additional information. For example, if you selected option 1 to build the model, the program will ask you to enter the name of the meta file and the name of the training file. Enter the requested information and press Enter.
9.	After selecting option 2 from the menu, the program will prompt you to enter the name of the input file that contains the test data. Enter the name of the file and press Enter. Next, the program will prompt you to enter the name of the output file where the classification results will be stored. Enter the name of the file and press Enter.
10.	After selecting option 3 from the menu, it will print the accuracy of the model on the console.
11.	After selecting option 4 from the menu, it will exit from the program.
